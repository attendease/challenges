# Attendease Coding Challenge 

## Event Listing Component

The Platform team has been tasked with building a new feature! At the request of our business and product team, our customers would like to see a way to aggregate all of an organizations existing events. We have an endpoint for all this data but we need a slick component to display it in the front-end. 

## The Task: 
For the MVP of this feature, the team would like to see this feature meet the following requirements:
- Each event listing should have the following fields (`name`, `days of the event`, `venue`, `url`)
- Ability to sort the events by `name` (Alphabetically, A-Z)
- Ability to sort the events by `date`. 
- Ability to `remove` an event listing from the collection. (No need to hit the API here, we still want to see it again if we refresh the page.)
- Ability to reset all the above functionality to revert the listing to its original state. 

You have been assigned this feature and have been given full autonomy over the design and UX of this component. In any front-end framework of your choosing please implement the requested feature. 

Technical Information:
This is a public api endpoint with some data for you to use! 
https://attendease.attendease.org/api/events.json

Optional: 
Bonus points if you deploy this via `Heroku` ;)

## Notes: 
- If an event has no venue, we assume that the event is a webinar. In the `venue` field this can just read `webinar`.
- You have 2 days(48hrs) to complete this challenge. If you have anything impeding you from completing, please let us know! 
- Good luck :) 

## Pro Tips:  
We will be evaluating you on the following criteria
40% Correctness/logic
40% Code quality/clarity,patterns
20% Process (commit messages, tests, output, task, environment/modules)

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns!
